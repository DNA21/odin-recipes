        <li>Place flour in shallow dish.  Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>

            side for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Turn heat down to medium.</li>
        <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter.  
            Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.
        </li>
        <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey.  Stir/shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then 
            simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.
